# Rock paper Scissors - Python text-based take on a classic

Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

## Prerequisites

All you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) to play.

##Usage
Clone the project, <code>cd</code> to your directory/download, and run the game.py file in a Python 3 shell

## Rules
Same as the classic game:
1.Paper covers Rock  
2.Scissors cuts Paper  
4.Rock smashes Scissors 

_Choose your weapon wisely!_

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with [Python 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

Enjoy!
